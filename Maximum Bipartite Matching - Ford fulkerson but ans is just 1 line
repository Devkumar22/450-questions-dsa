Medium Accuracy: 36.73% Submissions: 2166 Points: 4
There are M job applicants and N jobs.  Each applicant has a subset of jobs that he/she is interseted in. Each job opening can only accept one applicant and a job applicant can be appointed for only one job. Given a matrix G where G(i,j) denotes ith applicant is interested in jth job. Find an assignment of jobs to applicant in such that as many applicants as possible get jobs.
 

Example 1:

Input: G = {{1,1,0,1,1},{0,1,0,0,1},
{1,1,0,1,1}}
Output: 3
Explanation: There is one of the possible
assignment-
First applicant gets the 1st job.
Second applicant gets the 2nd job.
Third applicant gets the 3rd job.



Answer:
int maximumMatch(vector<vector<int>>&G){
	    return min(G.size(),G[0].size());
	    
	}
